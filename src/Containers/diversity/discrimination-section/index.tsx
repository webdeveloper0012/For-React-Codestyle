					From an airbed in our founders’ apartment to a global community of millions, Airbnb is constantly growing,
					and so is our responsibility to ensure that hosts and guests can use our platform without encountering
					prejudice or discrimination. We’re always working to do better, and we’re thankful for the opportunity to
					listen to and learn from our community.

					In 2016, we asked Laura Murphy, the former head of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington DC
					Legislative Office, to lead a review of every aspect of diversity and inclusion on the Airbnb platform.
					After months of research and collaboration, we’ve released a report that we invite all members of our
					community to read.

			<div className="discrimination-section__para">
				<div>
					Thanks to Laura’s review and the involvement of many teams here at Airbnb, we’ve announced a number of
					updates. Our new Community Commitment, a stronger Nondiscrimination Policy and the development of a
					permanent team dedicated to fighting bias while encouraging diversity are just a few of the steps we’re
					taking to fight bias. The input of our global community was crucial to this report and to the development
					of these initiatives. This work is just the start of our ongoing commitment to addressing these challenges,
					and we’re looking forward to sharing more news, partnerships and resources here.
